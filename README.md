# 🛍️ Situational Dev Challenges

A collection of real-world coding challenges designed to level up my backend development and problem-solving skills. Each project simulates a focused developer scenario—from REST API design and scraping tasks to algorithm-infused micro-services.

These challenges are built from scratch, without tutorials, to reinforce:

* 🧠 Recall-based coding and debugging
* 🧹 Pattern recognition with FastAPI, Docker, and Python
* 🧰 Real-world application of data structures & algorithms (NeetCode patterns)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.11**
* **FastAPI**
* **Docker**
* **Requests**, **BeautifulSoup**, **Playwright** *(varies by project)*
* **NeetCode Patterns:** Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Hashmaps
* **Testing:** `pytest` (select projects)

## 📚 Project Structure

Each challenge has its own folder with:

```
<challenge-folder>/
  ├── main.py or app.py       # Main logic
  ├── Dockerfile             # Containerized environment
  ├── README.md              # Challenge prompt, constraints, notes
  └── (optional files)        # test.csv, requirements.txt, etc.
```

---

## 🚀 Challenge Types

* API Services (CRUD, filters, queues)
* Scrapers & Data Processors
* Email tools, CSV utilities
* Algorithm-integrated systems (rate limiters, filters, matchers)

---

## 🧳️ Why This Repo Exists

To simulate the work of a solo dev, junior backend engineer, or SaaS builder:

* ✅ Build and debug without handholding
* ✅ Reinforce patterns and tooling fluency
* ✅ Apply DSA in useful, real-world ways

I'm documenting my journey to go from foundational Python skills to deep backend and AI/ML fluency through hands-on iteration.
